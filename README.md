#Competitive Programming
Ok, so this file logs my activities since 20th June 2018.
Here it goes!

1. Kept trying 10922; code gave right solution for large input on other IDEs, but got TLE verdict on UVa; came up with a (sort of) more efficient approach, but that too gave TLE.
2. Took part in Codeforces 991 (Div. 2); I THOUGHT I got 3 problems right (A,B,D), but I found out after the contest that my solution for the first problem was infact wrong:(; I'm pretty sure I had seen "pretest passed" during the contest; I couldn't do Probem C. Standing- 2132/4761; Rating increased by +1 to 1399.
3. Also, I got to know about hacking solutions!

1. tried to solve UVa 10212 in a different manner, but couln't get pass integer overflow; looked up solution and the solution was quite simple; I did have an idea of that solution, but I had got too lazy to think it through;
2. Solved UVa 10922; recursion problem where we have to use numbers as strings.
3. Started solving UVa 10609 (geometry problem with recursion); pretty much coded it, but it gave me a wrong set of points.

[21/6/18]--
1. tried (UVa) 10212; got WA and TLE while testing; 
2. participated in Codeforces 999 Div.3; got 3/6 problems; 4th problem gave tle (could be wrong algorithm too); standing-1505/5482. Rating increased by +30 to 1398.

[20/6/18]--
1. tried 992D; couldn't find an efficient solution at first; thought up an approach with maps but couldn't be implemented because integer overflow:(; looked up editorial... and didn't understand it.
